# Codex Design System
Welcome! We're trying to create a set of guidelines, constrains and components that would shape our Design System. We would apply the solutions consistently across all VSTS, making sure people would enjoy an awesome experience.

Constrains generates creativity… embrace them! This system is alive, we're constantly pushing updates and expanding on cases as the product evolves.
